### Features:

1. **Search Functionality**:

   - A user-friendly search bar allows users to find stocks by their symbols.

2. **Stock Quote Display**:

   - Key details for selected stocks, including:
     - Symbol
     - Current Price
     - Price Change (Amount and Percentage)
     - Optional Information: Company Name, Market Cap, P/E Ratio, etc.

3. **Watchlist**:

   - Add and remove stocks for quick access to frequently monitored symbols.

4. **Real-Time Data Fetching**:

   - Retrieves up-to-date stock quotes via a custom API built using FastAPI. This approach was chosen because free APIs often limit the number of calls (e.g., up to 5 calls), making them unsuitable for real-time data requirements.
   - All API files are located in the **server** folder. Please refer to this folder for implementation details.

5. **State Management**:

   - Efficient state handling using tools like Provider or BLoC.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - Graceful handling of issues like invalid stock symbols, API errors, and network failures.

7. **Manual or Auto Refresh (Optional)**:

   - Users can manually refresh stock data or enable background updates at regular intervals.

8. **Responsive Design**:

   - Optimized for various screen sizes and device orientations.

9. **Offline Support (Optional)**:

   - Caching recently accessed stock information for offline viewing.

10. **Industry Sector Grouping (Bonus)**:

    - View stock quotes grouped by industry sectors, enhancing data organization and analysis.

11. **CI/CD Pipeline**:

    - The project integrates a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient and reliable development workflows.
